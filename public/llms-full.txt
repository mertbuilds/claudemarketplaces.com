# Claude Code Marketplaces - Comprehensive LLM Context
# https://claudemarketplaces.com

# OVERVIEW
Claude Code Marketplaces is the definitive automated directory for discovering Claude Code plugins, extensions, and tools. It continuously monitors GitHub to find and validate all available Claude Code plugin marketplaces, providing developers with instant access to the entire ecosystem.

# WHAT IS CLAUDE CODE?
Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings Claude AI capabilities to developers' coding workflows. It supports plugins and extensions through marketplace repositories hosted on GitHub.

# WHAT ARE PLUGIN MARKETPLACES?
Plugin marketplaces are GitHub repositories containing:
- A .claude-plugin/marketplace.json file (schema-validated)
- Collections of related plugins
- Plugin metadata (descriptions, categories, installation instructions)
- Development tools, productivity extensions, testing utilities, and integrations

# HOW IT WORKS
1. Automatic Discovery: GitHub API searches daily for repositories with valid marketplace.json files
2. Schema Validation: Each marketplace is validated against official Claude Code schema
3. Metadata Extraction: Plugin count, descriptions, categories, and GitHub stars
4. Quality Filter: Only marketplaces with 5+ GitHub stars are included (ensures community validation)
5. Regular Updates: Marketplace information refreshes daily
6. Community Ranking: Sort by GitHub stars to discover popular plugins
